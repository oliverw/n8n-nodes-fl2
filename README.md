## Credentials

This Node operates on the **FL2 REST API**. To access the API, you must authenticate each request using a **Bearer Token** associated with your account.

Before you can generate a token, you'll need a LinkBrain account. 

1. **Sign up for free** at [https://app.fl2.io/signup](https://app.fl2.io/signup) 
2. **Sign in** to your account at [https://app.fl2.io](https://app.fl2.io/signin) 

### Obtaining an API Token 

Once signed in, you can generate your personal API token: 

1. Navigate to **Integrations → API**, or open [https://app.fl2.io/integrations/api](https://app.fl2.io/integrations/api) directly. 
2. Click **Generate Token** to create a new Bearer Token. 
3. Copy the token --- you'll need it for authenticating API requests.
